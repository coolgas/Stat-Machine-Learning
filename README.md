# Stat-Machine-Learning
This is a small project working on simulating Ising model with two distinct methods, one is so-called mean field theory which is statistical physics related, another
is belief propagation. The results showed that under certain threshold of spin numbers and the strength of spin couplings, the error of BP is significantly lower than that of MF.
As the system moves across the thresholds, both methods fail to simulate the Ising model.
